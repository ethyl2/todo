# TODO App

This project uses Backbone.js.
The original code is found here: https://github.com/udacity/ud989-todo-app

Added Features:

1. A completion message is displayed when a todo item is marked as completed.
2. Now an edit button appears after each item for handy access to the edit mode.
3. A priority button before each item allows the user to toggle whether each item
  should be displayed as having priority. Priority items are displayed in red.
4. A time-sensitive button before each item allows the user to toggle whether
  each item should be displayed as being time-sensitive (AKA urgent). Time-
  sensitive items are displayed in italics with a yellow background.
